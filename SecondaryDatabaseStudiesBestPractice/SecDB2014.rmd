## What is a secondary database?

--- &twocol

## A secondary database for research is

*** =left

- A collection of data/datasets collected for a purpose other than the current
  study
- Examples
  - Electronic medical record
  - Administrative databases (insurance claims, PBS, etc.)

*** =right

![ipm-img](Images/ipm.png)

---

## Why?

- No RCTs available
  - Questionable ethics
  - Time
  - Money
- No prospective observational data
- Differences in target populations
- Lack of 'important' outcomes in RCTs
  - Many look at intermediate outcomes

--- &twocoluser wid1:60% wid2:36%

## Benefits of a prospective RCT/cohort study

*** =left

- Validity
- Direct measurements (i.e. pre-specified)
- (in the case of the RCT) Randomisation
  - We get balance of confounders

<span style="font-weight:bold">Table 1. Characteristics of the patients at
baseline.</span>

| Variable | Control Group | Intervention Group |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sex, n (%)  | B | C |
| Age, year (IQR) | D | E |
| Current smoking, n (%) | F | G |

- We'd like to mimic the benefits of an RCT in a retrospective comparative study

## Challenges in study design

--- {tpl: tabs}

## Specification of the protocol

*** {class: active, id: Protocol}

- 'Protocol' is sometimes misconstrued
- These are **always** fully-specified for an RCT
  - Inclusion/exclusion criteria
  - Definition of primary and secondary outcomes
  - Analytical considerations
	- These are (generally) easier for RCTs

*** {class: class, id: STROBE}

<iframe src="http://www.strobe-statement.org"></iframe>

*** {class: class, id: SPIRIT}

<iframe src="http://www.spirit-statement.org"></iframe>


--- &twocol

## Study design

*** =left

- No different to prospective studies
- Pre-specified hypotheses (within limits)
  - Specifically: one primary outcome
- (Obviously) depends on the question of interest
  - Cohort/case-control/interrupted time-series

*** =right

## Biases

---

## Misclassification

- A big issue in secondary data studies
- Data are collected for different purposes
- Recreating a diagnosis/outcome from patient notes may be challenging
  - Clear classification schemes will help
  - These should be pre-specified

---

## Confounding

- Independent (causal) risk factor, that is also associated with the exposure of
  interest, but not an intermediate on the causal pathway
- Randomisation gives balance in measured **and** unmeasured confounders
- Confounding by indication
  - E.g. we wish to compare drug A to drug B
  - Drug A is prescribed more than drug B in people who are more ill
  - However, severity of the illness also impacts the outcome

--- .segue .dark

## Methods of analysis

<!-- Straight comparisons are generally not valid, due to the biases and -->
<!-- imbalances already discussed -->

---

## Common methods

- Stratification
  - Compare groups A and B in strata X and Y
- Regression
  - Compare groups A and B after adjusting for X and Y
- Matching
  - Compare groups A and B after matching on X and Y

--- &twocoluser wid1:60% wid2:36%

## Stratification

*** =left

- Common for age and sex
  - Break age into 10 year groups
- Calculate the <a rel="popover"
  data-content="For example, the odds ratio of the outcome comparing two drugs."
  data-original-title="Statistic of interest" id='example'>statistic</a> of
  interest in each each combination of strata
  - {20-29 y.o. males, 20-29 y.o. females, 30-29 y.o. males, etc.}
- Combine them in a 'suitable' way
  - E.g. Mantel-Haenszel gives weight to strata with larger sample sizes
- Good first exploratory step
- Acts as a check for (multivariable) regression

*** =right

### <span style="color:#97004D">Problems</span>

- Defining suitable strata
  - Particularly with continuous variables
- Sparsity in strata
  - E.g. not many 90+ y.o. males

---

## Regression

- Simultaneous adjustment for all confounders/covariates
- Present the full model
  - Not just the effect of interest
- Use the literature to support:
  - Variable specification
  - Model specification

--- &twocol

## Regression (cont'd)

*** =left

### <span style="color:#97004D">Variable specification</span>

- Should **not** be determined by 'univariate' models and p-cutoffs
- Supported by in-depth literature review
- Include irrespective of 'statistical significance' at traditional cutoffs
  - This is arbitrary and leads to biased estimates
- 'Grouped' procedures work well

*** =right

### <span style="color:#97004D">Model specification</span>

- Specification to meet the outcome:
  - Logistic regression for binary (Yes/No, Dead/Alive) outcomes
  - Poisson regression for counts
  - Cox proportional hazard models for time to event outcomes
  - Multilevel/random effect models for clustered data

--- {tpl: tabs}

## Matching

*** {class: active, id: Matching}

- 'Balance' potential confounders
- Blunt instrument
- With many confounders it will obviously be difficult
  - Some 'relaxation' may be required
  - E.g. age +/- 10 years, rather than 5 years
- Specialised methods of analysis then required
  - E.g. conditional logistic regression

*** {class: class, id: Propensities}

- More sophisticated way of providing balance
- Model the 'propensity' to receive treatment/exposure A vs. B
- For analysis, can then use any of the previous
  - Stratification: stratify on the propensity score
  - Regression: Use the propensity score as a weight or as a covariate
  - Matching: match on the propensity score
