## Study design

*** =left

- Pre-specified hypotheses (within limits)
  - Specifically: one primary outcome
- (Obviously) depends on the question of interest
  - Cohort/case-control/interrupted time-series

## Experimental or observational?

- Experimental studies
  - Exposure (intervention) assigned by the researcher
- Observational studies
  - Exposure is not assigned by the researcher

<hr size=4px color="#97004D">

- Today's focus is on observational studies

--- &twocol

## Comparative studies

*** =left

- Many studies look at comparing levels of an exposure
  - E.g. surgical vs. conservative management
- In observational studies this means <a rel="popover"
  data-content="Independent (causal) risk factor, that is also associated with
  the exposure of interest, but not an intermediate on the causal pathway"
  data-original-title="Confounding" id='example'>confounding</a>
- Standard methods of minimising confounding:
  - Stratification
  - Regression
  - Matching

*** =right

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
require(ggplot2)
x <- runif(100, min = 20, max = 80)
y <- 3 + 0.25*x - 0.005*(x - 50)^2 + rnorm(100, sd = 2)
pl <- ggplot(data.frame(x, y), aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
print(pl)
```

## Sideways into regression...
<!-- Make this a quiz slide? -->
- What does a randomised intervention give us?

1. A normal distribution
2. A headache
3. _Balance in confounders_
4. All of the above

*** .hint

As John McEnroe said: You can't be *serious*?

*** .explanation

<ol start=3 type="1">
<li>Comparative observational studies will <em>almost always</em> require adjustment
for confounders</li>

## What's my outcome?

## Outcome types

*** {class: active, id: Binary}

- Binary outcome studies are characterised by an event occuring (or not)
  - **within** a prespecified time interval

### <span style="color:#97004D">Standard analyses</span>

- Differences in proportions
  - Perhaps after propensity score matching
- Logistic regression

*** {id: Incidences}

- Studies looking at *incidence* involve time
  - and are presented in terms of *rates* or *risks* per unit time

### <span style="color:#97004D">Standard analyses</span>

- Involve the time aspect
  - *Time-to-event* analyses
  - Kaplan-Meier curves
  - Cox proportional hazards models
  - Semiparameteric risk models

*** {id: Counts}

- Count outcomes arise when recurring events can happen
  - and are presented in terms of *rates* per unit time
  - E.g. ED admissions

### <span style="color:#97004D">Standard analyses</span>

- May (or may not) involve a time aspect
  - Poisson regression

*** {id: Continuous}

- Continuous outcomes are those that take the form of a *number*
  - We often present these as *standardised* differences

### <span style="color:#97004D">Standard analyses</span>

- Should be confined to a standardised time interval
  - Analysis generally takes the form of a linear regression
- Why a standardised time interval?
  - Because continuous outcomes often depend on time/duration from the exposure
  - E.g. quality of life
- If possible, should always seek a baseline measure of the outcome
