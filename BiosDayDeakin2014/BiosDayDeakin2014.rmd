## What is functional data analysis?

<!-- Include R logo? -->

---

### Two scenarios

- But one theme!
- Object of analysis is a curve observed on a:
  - dense grid, over the full domain of interest
  - sparse grid, within a subset of the domain of interest

---

### Fine grid, full measurement domain
<!-- Example from my regression tree paper? Cool interactive graph! -->
- [Handwriting example](http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/)

---

### Sparse grid, subset of measurement domain
<!-- (Interactive?) graphic of BMD measurements, highlighting a couple of -->
<!-- different individuals with varying numbers of measurements. -->
- Bone mineral density measurements

---

### (Some) mathematical/statistical details

<!-- Slide (or a couple) to include the nuts and bolts -->
<!-- Refs as footers, as it doesn't work with pandoc yet. -->

## Application to a longitudinal cohort study

---

### Geelong Osteoporosis Study (GOS)

<!-- Slides (perhaps multiple) of GOS description -->

---

### Can we use FDA to fit and then predict future BMD trajectories?

<!-- Details of process, cross-validation study, metrics used to see if it works -->

---

### Is this information useful?

<!-- Probably more useful is to give intervals and probabilities of events -->
<!-- happening, e.g. the probability of losing more than 5% BMD in a given -->
<!-- period. Can get this using posterior simulations. -->

<section>

## Where to from here?

---

### What is the impact of an acute event?

<!-- ICU stay, are these any different? Give what I'm thinking, then perhaps -->
<!-- note the landmarking work, and the Stat. Med. paper just out -->

---

### Are those with an acute event just 'different'?

<!-- Maybe doesn't need its own page, but this is the clustering stuff. We could -->
<!-- either try and 'discover' two clusters and see if more ICU guys fell into -->
<!-- either, or label them and calculate differences? -->
