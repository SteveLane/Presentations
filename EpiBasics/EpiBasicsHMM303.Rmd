## What is epidemiology?

- [WHO](http://www.who.int/topics/epidemiology/en/)

> Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of
> health-related states or events (including disease), and the application of
> this study to the control of diseases and other health
> problems.

- [BMJ](http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-readers/publications/epidemiology-uninitiated/1-what-epidemiology)

> Epidemiology is the study of how often diseases occur in different groups of
> people and why. Epidemiological information is used to plan and evaluate
> strategies to prevent illness and as a guide to the management of patients in
> whom disease has already developed.

- 'The study of what is upon the people' (Greek)

## Measuring occurrence

---

## What do we mean by occurrence?

<!-- We often want to know what causes disease, so we need to measure how often -->
<!-- it occurs. -->

- Prevalence
  - How many persons *have* the disease at a given point in time
- Incidence
  - How many persons *get* the disease within a certain time period

--- {tpl: tabs}

## HIV

*** {class: active, id: Prevalence}

<iframe src="http://bit.ly/1FQ7B6a"></iframe>

*** {id: Incidence-proportion}

<iframe src="http://bit.ly/1G1TvnE"></iframe>

---

## Measuring prevalence

- Prevalence is often not the main goal
  - Why? It focuses on the *existing* disease state
- Prevalence is affected both by incidence rate *and* duration of disease
- But: it can be easy to measure
  1. Take a sample from your population
  2. Ask/test if they have the disease of interest
  3. Calculate prevalence as the number of diseased in the sample

---

## Measuring incidence

- Incidence is often the major focus
  - Why? It focuses on the *change* in disease state (i.e. new events occurring)
- But: it is harder to measure
  1. We need to sample an at risk population
  2. We need to record the period in which they are at risk
  3. We need to record who has disease onset (and when)
  4. Calculate incidence rate as<br>
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
    \text{i.r.} & = \frac{\text{number of disease onsets}}{\sum_{\text{persons}}\text{time at risk}}
  \end{aligned}
  $$

---

## Measuring incidence (contd.)

- Time is key in incidence
  - So different *times* can give the same incidence
- Example: 1 case per 100 years. This could be find by either
  - Following 100 people for an average of 1 year, and observing 1 case; or
  - Following 2 people for 50 years, and observing 1 case.
- Incidences are not proportions, so don't confuse them with risks!

## Types of studies

<!-- We know what we want to calculate, but how do we get data to calculate it? -->

---

## Next page!

## Gapminder

- This is to go somewhere, maybe in the workshop session
- [Gapminder](http://bit.ly/1INnTTu)

---

## Once a cause is identified...

- Epidemiologic attention turns to defining risk factors for acquisition,
  progression or recovery, and transmission (Rothman et al., 2008)

## A secondary database for research is

*** =left

- A collection of data/datasets collected for a purpose other than the current
  study
- Examples
  - Electronic medical record
  - Administrative databases (insurance claims, PBS, etc.)

*** =right

## Why?

- No RCTs available
  - Questionable ethics
  - Time
  - Money
- No prospective observational data
- Differences in target populations
- Lack of 'important' outcomes in RCTs
  - Many look at intermediate outcomes

--- &twocoluser wid1:60% wid2:36%

## Benefits of a prospective RCT/cohort study

*** =left

- Validity
- Direct measurements (i.e. pre-specified)
- (in the case of the RCT) Randomisation
  - We get balance of confounders

<span style="font-weight:bold">Table 1. Characteristics of the patients at
baseline.</span>

| Variable | Control Group | Intervention Group |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sex, n (%)  | B | C |
| Age, year (IQR) | D | E |
| Current smoking, n (%) | F | G |

- We'd like to mimic the benefits of an RCT in a retrospective comparative study

## Challenges in study design

--- &twocol

## Study design

*** =left

- No different to prospective studies
- Pre-specified hypotheses (within limits)
  - Specifically: one primary outcome
- (Obviously) depends on the question of interest
  - Cohort/case-control/interrupted time-series

*** =right

## Biases

---

## Misclassification

- A big issue in secondary data studies
- Data are collected for different purposes
- Recreating a diagnosis/outcome from patient notes may be challenging
  - Clear classification schemes will help
  - These should be pre-specified

---

## Confounding

- Independent (causal) risk factor, that is also associated with the exposure of
  interest, but not an intermediate on the causal pathway
- Randomisation gives balance in measured **and** unmeasured confounders
- Confounding by indication
  - E.g. we wish to compare drug A to drug B
  - Drug A is prescribed more than drug B in people who are more ill
  - However, severity of the illness also impacts the outcome

--- .segue .dark

## Methods of analysis

<!-- Straight comparisons are generally not valid, due to the biases and -->
<!-- imbalances already discussed -->

---

## Common methods

- Stratification
  - Compare groups A and B in strata X and Y
- Regression
  - Compare groups A and B after adjusting for X and Y
- Matching
  - Compare groups A and B after matching on X and Y

--- &twocoluser wid1:60% wid2:36%

## Stratification

*** =left

- Common for age and sex
  - Break age into 10 year groups
- Calculate the <a rel="popover"
  data-content="For example, the odds ratio of the outcome comparing two drugs."
  data-original-title="Statistic of interest" id='example'>statistic</a> of
  interest in each each combination of strata
  - {20-29 y.o. males, 20-29 y.o. females, 30-29 y.o. males, etc.}
- Combine them in a 'suitable' way
  - E.g. Mantel-Haenszel gives weight to strata with larger sample sizes
- Good first exploratory step
- Acts as a check for (multivariable) regression

*** =right

### <span style="color:#97004D">Problems</span>

- Defining suitable strata
  - Particularly with continuous variables
- Sparsity in strata
  - E.g. not many 90+ y.o. males

---

## Regression

- Simultaneous adjustment for all confounders/covariates
- Present the full model
  - Not just the effect of interest
- Use the literature to support:
  - Variable specification
  - Model specification

--- &twocol

## Regression (cont'd)

*** =left

### <span style="color:#97004D">Variable specification</span>

- Should **not** be determined by 'univariate' models and p-cutoffs
- Supported by in-depth literature review
- Include irrespective of 'statistical significance' at traditional cutoffs
  - This is arbitrary and leads to biased estimates
- 'Grouped' procedures work well

*** =right

### <span style="color:#97004D">Model specification</span>

- Specification to meet the outcome:
  - Logistic regression for binary (Yes/No, Dead/Alive) outcomes
  - Poisson regression for counts
  - Cox proportional hazard models for time to event outcomes
  - Multilevel/random effect models for clustered data

--- {tpl: tabs}

## Matching

*** {class: active, id: Matching}

- 'Balance' potential confounders
- Blunt instrument
- With many confounders it will obviously be difficult
  - Some 'relaxation' may be required
  - E.g. age +/- 10 years, rather than 5 years
- Specialised methods of analysis then required
  - E.g. conditional logistic regression

*** {class: class, id: Propensities}

- More sophisticated way of providing balance
- Model the 'propensity' to receive treatment/exposure A vs. B
- For analysis, can then use any of the previous
  - Stratification: stratify on the propensity score
  - Regression: Use the propensity score as a weight or as a covariate
  - Matching: match on the propensity score
